# Software Engineering at SoftUni (Software University)

Information about overall program
```
The studying program of the Software University is a combination of programming courses, 
entirely focused on gaining in depth knowledge of fundamentals of programming, developing 
logical and algorithmic thinking, as well as acquiring of practical skills to work with the 
latest software technologies.

The schedule provides a choice of 4 professions focused on C#, Java, JavaScript and PHP 
technologies, each profession includes modules lasting 4 months and each module combines 
2 or 3 courses. The lessons in the courses are divided into lectures and exercises, each 
course ends with a practical and theoretical exam.

## Programming Basics with Java

```
The "Programming Basics" course gives you the first steps in to programming. In this 
course you will learn basic coding skills, how to work with IDE and console, how to 
use statements(if, if-else), loops(for, while, do-while) and variables.
```

## Technology Fundamentals with PHP
```
In "Technology Fundamentals" module you will extend the knowledge from "Programming Basics".
Also you will gain skills with basic techniques and tool which are used in more practical 
programs. Along with programming techniques, the module develops algorithmic thinking 
and builds problem-solving skills by working on hundreds of hands-on exercises.
```

## PHP WEB Basics
```
The PHP Web Basics course will introduce you to the basics of web programming with PHP. 
The principles and peculiarities of object-oriented programming are studied, with direct
application in the work with database information and dynamic web content. Basic 
concepts of web technologies such as HTTP protocol and user data processing through 
forms are discussed. The acquired skills allow the development of a complete dynamic 
web application with the possibility of user authentication (registration with a 
name and password) related to a database.
```

## PHP MVC Frameworks
```
The PHP MVC Frameworks course will teach you how to build modern Web applications based on 
the Model-View-Controller template using a technology framework. Universal techniques for 
working with dynamic content are being studied, which are applied in practically every web 
application - using HTML templates, querying, presenting information in objects related 
to relational database and more. The training also addresses more complex topics related 
to application validation and security, as well as automation of server activities. 
The course ends with the development and protection of a practical web project.
```
## JavaScript Advanced

```
In JS Advanced you will gain in-depth knowledge in JavaScript as you study more sophisticated
concepts like: IIFE and Clousure. Also in this course you will learn more about the DOM tree 
and how to manipulate it(add elements and delete them), how to unit test your code and more
about the OOP(object oriented programming) part of programming with JS.
```

## JavaScript Applications

```
In the "JS Applications" course you will learn what HTTP requests are and how to use them. 
You will be introduced to REST Services, what databases are and how to handle them, what is 
asynchronous code, what are Templating and Routing. You will understand what the architecture 
of an application is and how to properly structure your applications.

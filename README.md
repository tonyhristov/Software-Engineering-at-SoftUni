# Software Engineering at SoftUni (Software University)

Information about overall program

```
The studying program of the Software University is a combination of programming courses,
entirely focused on gaining in-depth knowledge of fundamentals of programming, developing
logical and algorithmic thinking, as well as acquiring practical skills to work with the
latest software technologies.

The schedule provides a choice of 4 professions focused on C#, Java, JavaScript, and PHP
technologies, each profession includes modules lasting 4 months and each module combines
2 or 3 courses. The lessons in the courses are divided into lectures and exercises,
each course ends with a practical and theoretical exam.

## Programming Basics with Java

```
The "Programming Basics" course gives you the first steps into programming. In this
course you will learn basic coding skills, how to work with IDE and console, how to
use statements(if, if-else), loops(for, while, do-while) and variables.
```

## Technology Fundamentals with PHP

```
In the "Technology Fundamentals" module you will extend the knowledge from "Programming Basics".
Also, you will gain skills with basic techniques and tool which are used in more practical
programs. Along with programming techniques, the module develops algorithmic thinking and builds
problem-solving skills by working on hundreds of hands-on exercises.
```

## PHP WEB Basics

```
The PHP Web Basics course will introduce you to the basics of web programming with PHP.
The principles and peculiarities of object-oriented programming are studied, with direct
application in the work with database information and dynamic web content. Basic concepts of web
technologies such as HTTP protocol and user data processing through forms are discussed.
The acquired skills allow the development of a complete dynamic web application with the
possibility of user authentication (registration with a name and password) related to a database.
```

## PHP MVC Frameworks

```
The PHP MVC Frameworks course will teach you how to build modern Web applications based on the
Model-View-Controller template using a technology framework. Universal techniques for working with
dynamic content are being studied, which are applied in practically every web application - using
HTML templates, querying, presenting information in objects related to relational database and more.
The training also addresses more complex topics related to application validation and security,
as well as automation of server activities. The course ends with the development and protection
of a practical web project.
```

## JavaScript Advanced

```
In JS Advanced you will gain in-depth knowledge in JavaScript as you study more sophisticated
concepts like IIFE and Clousure. Also in this course, you will learn more about the DOM tree
and how to manipulate it(add elements and delete them), how to unit test your code and more
about the OOP(object-oriented programming) part of programming with JS.
```

## JavaScript Applications

```
In the "JS Applications" course you will learn what HTTP requests are and how to use them.
You will be introduced to REST Services, what databases are and how to handle them, what is
asynchronous code, what are Templating and Routing. You will understand what the architecture
of an application is and how to properly structure your applications.
```

## JS Back-End

```
The course aims to introduce students to the development of server-side JavaScript applications
on the Node.js platform, using Express.js as a framework. During the training students will learn
how to create a server with Node.js, server-client architecture and how to make easy and fast
data-driven web applications with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, using modern techniques and tools.
```

## ReactJS

```
The training provides knowledge and practical skills for the development of Single Page Applications
(SPA), using ReactJS - one of the most popular and fast libraries for displaying the client interface,
developed and maintained by Facebook and Instagram.

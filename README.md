use statements(if, if-else), loops(for, while, do-while) and variables.
```

# Technology Fundamentals with PHP
```
In "Technology Fundamentals" module you will extend the knowledge from "Programming Basics".
Also you will gain skills with basic techniques and tool which are used in more practical 
programs. Along with programming techniques, the module develops algorithmic thinking 
and builds problem-solving skills by working on hundreds of hands-on exercises.
```

# PHP WEB Basics
```
The PHP Web Basics course will introduce you to the basics of web programming with PHP. 
The principles and peculiarities of object-oriented programming are studied, with direct
application in the work with database information and dynamic web content. Basic 
concepts of web technologies such as HTTP protocol and user data processing through

the Model-View-Controller template using a technology framework. Universal techniques for 
working with dynamic content are being studied, which are applied in practically every web 
application - using HTML templates, querying, presenting information in objects related 
to relational database and more. The training also addresses more complex topics related 
to application validation and security, as well as automation of server activities. 
The course ends with the development and protection of a practical web project.
